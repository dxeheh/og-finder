# og-finder
og-finder is a script designed using the NameMC *"API"* to scan for any unclaimed english words. You can specify what lengths of names you desire, but keep in mind the more words you have the longer it will take. Right now many words may appear that don't really look like English words. More options as far as complexity will be added soon. See the To-Do Section for more details..
## Getting Started
og-finder is not particurally difficult to install, but here's some basic information about the setup process.
### Prerequisites
This is a list of things you need to get before you can use og-finder. I'll update it when (if) there's any more, but there won't be.
```
Python 3.x
```
### Installing
Installing is as easy as clicking the green button that says `Clone or download` and then `Open in Desktop` or `Download Zip`.  
If you want you can use git to clone it using this command, but if you're reading this you probably don't have it installed.
```
git clone https://githib.com/dxeheh/og-finder
```
## Using og-finder
og-finder is run by double clicking on the script itself. It provides you with the necessary prompt for you to go out and begin searching.  
Example:  
```
og-finder v1.3

Beginning check for avaliable names...

Unavaiable: and

And so on.
## To-Do
A list of features that may or may not be ever added.
* Threading
* Add dictionaries of various complexities.
* Improve error support
* Add a more "brute-force" way of searching (not dictionary based)
